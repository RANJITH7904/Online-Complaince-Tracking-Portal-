📌 Project Overview

  The Online Complaint Tracking Portal is a web-based application designed to simplify the process of registering, tracking, and managing complaints digitally. It replaces manual complaint handling systems with a centralized, transparent, and efficient online solution.

Users can submit complaints, track their status, and view updates, while administrators can manage, update, and resolve complaints through an admin dashboard.

🎯 Aim
